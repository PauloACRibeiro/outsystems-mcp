# OutSystems - Remote MCP

You are connected to OutSystems over the MCP HTTP transport. OutSystems is a cloud-native low-code platform where apps are built from OML (OutSystems Model Language), a binary format describing entities, screens, actions, and logic. Every tool call carries the harness's validated OAuth bearer; tenant + user identity are derived from the JWT, not from arguments.

## First use / setup

The Power doesn't ship its own MCP server config — the agent writes the tenant URL straight into Kiro's user-level `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`. Do this once; the edit is idempotent for re-runs against a different tenant, and it survives Kiro's "Check for updates → Install updates" flow (which wipes per-Power config files).

Trigger conditions (any of):
- The user asks for anything OutSystems-related AND `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` has no `outsystems` key under top-level `mcpServers`.
- A call returns `tenant not configured` / connection errors.
- The user explicitly asks to switch tenants (e.g. "switch OutSystems to a different tenant", "point this at `<other-tenant>`").

Steps:

1. **Ask the user for their OutSystems tenant hostname.** Format: `<tenant>.outsystems.dev` (e.g. `mycompany.outsystems.dev`, `mytenant.outsystems.dev`). The tenant slug is whatever the user chose; do not assume a fixed `<short>-<region>-<index>` pattern. Prompt verbatim:
   > "Which OutSystems tenant should I connect to? It's the host portion of your OutSystems URL, typically something like `mycompany.outsystems.dev`."
2. **Normalize, then validate.** Accept whatever the user gives you (URL, hostname, hostname-with-path). Strip the scheme (`https://`, `http://`), any leading `www.`, trailing slash, and any path or query — keep only the host. The result must match `^[A-Za-z0-9]([A-Za-z0-9.-]*[A-Za-z0-9])?$`. Only ask again if the normalized value is still implausible (empty, contains whitespace, or clearly isn't a hostname).
3. **Construct the URL**: `https://<TENANT>/mcp`.
4. **Patch `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`.** Use Read + Write: read first, preserve every other entry, write back. Never clobber siblings. If the file has comments (JSONC), preserve them. Set top-level `mcpServers.outsystems` to:
   ```
   {"type": "http", "url": "<URL>", "timeout": 100000}
   ```
   ALWAYS keep top-level `mcpServers` as an object (Kiro's user-level loader rejects the file without it).
5. **Tell the user** Kiro's MCP file watcher will reload within a few seconds. Then proceed to the "Authenticating" section below; the agent drives the OAuth flow on the first OutSystems tool call.
6. **Retry the user's original request** once authentication completes.

If the user later asks to switch tenants, repeat this flow; the patch overwrites the URL idempotently.

## Authenticating

OAuth-protected. The harness exposes two deferred tools; the agent drives the flow — the user does NOT click anywhere in Kiro's UI.

- `mcp__outsystems__authenticate`: starts the OAuth flow; returns an authorization URL.
- `mcp__outsystems__complete_authentication { callback_url }`: finalizes auth for remote sessions.

**Lazy.** Before the first OutSystems tool call in a session, call `mcp__outsystems__authenticate` and share the returned URL with the user. Then:

- **Local session** (browser can reach `http://localhost:<port>/callback`): the server's real tools appear automatically — wait for the user's confirmation, then proceed.
- **Remote session** (callback page fails to load, e.g. SSH / devcontainer): have the user copy the full URL from their browser's address bar (`http://localhost:<port>/callback?code=...&state=...`) and call `mcp__outsystems__complete_authentication { callback_url: "<that URL>" }`.

**Reactive.** On `data.category: "AuthError"` mid-session (token expired, refresh denied, etc.): call `mcp__outsystems__authenticate` again, then retry the original call ONCE.

**Don't fall back to removing and re-adding the server in Kiro's MCP UI** — the deferred tool pair is always available; UI removal is the host's emergency fallback.

**If `authenticate` itself errors** (server unreachable, DCR fails): surface the message verbatim and file against `OutSystems/outsystems-mcp`. Don't speculate about server internals.

## Tools at a glance

Tool catalog and per-tool semantics live in the MCP server's `tools/list`; treat each tool's `description` + `inputSchema` as the source of truth, since defaults can change server-side. Tools group as:

- **Apps**: `app_list`, `app_info`, `app_refs`
- **Context Service** (seven typed lookups): `context_entities`, `context_actions`, `context_screens`, `context_structures`, `context_roles`, `context_themes`, `context_connections`
- **Mentor** (server-side OML editing): `mentor_start`, `mentor_get_run`, `mentor_cancel`
- **Publish**: `publish_start`, `publish_status`, `publish_logs`
- **Deployments**: `deploy_start`, `deploy_status`, `deploy_messages`, `deploy_rollback`, `deploy_impact`, `deploy_impact_status`
- **External libraries**: `extlib_upload`, `extlib_publish`, `extlib_status`, `extlib_logs`, `extlib_download_source`, `extlib_download_status`
- **Environments**: `env_list`

### Caveats

Cross-tool behaviors not expressible in a single per-tool description:

- **`deploy_start` — `from_env` required when both `build_key` and `revision` are omitted and `operation != "Undeploy"`.** The target `env_key` is not used as the source environment on HTTP.
- **`publish_start` — `app_key` comes from the `mentor_session_token` claims, not arguments.** Required params: `mentor_session_id`, `mentor_session_token`, `env_key`. An explicit `app_key` is ignored.
- **`extlib_upload` — 50 MB decoded cap (~67 MB encoded `zip_b64`); per-replica concurrency gating.** Pre-flight rejects oversize payloads; concurrent uploads queue per replica rather than reject.
- **`context_*` — `owned_only` defaults to `true` when `app` is set, `false` tenant-wide.** Pass `owned_only: false` with `app` to keep rows inherited from referenced libraries (OutSystemsUI, Charts, etc.).

## Rules

- **Agent-facing tools.** Don't expose raw tool output; extract the relevant fields and present them naturally.
- **Go straight to the task.** No setup checks, no auth pre-flight beyond the lazy `authenticate` described above; identity comes from the harness-negotiated bearer.
- **OML stays server-side.** No `app_download`. Inspect with `app_refs` + `context_*`; edit with the mentor flow (`mentor_start` → poll `mentor_get_run`). The OML lives in the server-side mentor session and never crosses the wire as bytes.
- **Never guess opaque IDs.** If `env_key`, `app_key`, an asset key, or a `mentor_session_*` token is missing and you can't resolve it, ask the user.
- **No selected environment.** Every environment-scoped tool takes `env_key` per call.
- **Parallelize independent calls** (e.g. once you have an app key, fetch `app_info` + the per-type `context_*` lookups concurrently).
- **Use `data.category`, not message text, for error retry decisions.** Categories: `AuthError`, `ValidationError`, `UpstreamError`, `InternalError`; upstream errors also carry `data.upstream_status`.
- **Long-running tools return an id; poll for status.** Applies to all `deploy_*` (status via `deploy_status` / `deploy_impact_status`), `publish_start` (via `publish_status`), `extlib_*` operations (via `extlib_status` / `extlib_download_status`), and mentor (`mentor_start` returns a `runId`; poll `mentor_get_run` until terminal; `mentor_cancel` to abort). Per-tool polling shape is in each tool's live description.
- **Pace polls at ~30s; don't bare-sleep.** Bare `sleep N` is blocked by Claude Code and others — use your harness's background-sleep (Claude Code: `Bash {command: "sleep 30", run_in_background: true}`). Full pattern: "Pacing polls" under Mentor.

## Names

- `name` is the display form (may contain spaces, e.g. `"AI Agent Feedback Portal"`); `assetName` is the internal identifier (e.g. `"AIAgentFeedbackPortal"`). The `app:` parameter on `context_*` and `app_list --search` accepts either — case-insensitive substring match against both the display name and its space-stripped variant.
- The canonical identifier is the **asset key** (UUID). Prefer it across calls; names can be edited, the key is stable.

## Mentor session round-trip

Mentor is a multi-turn conversation backed by a server-side session that holds the loaded OML. Driven via the async surface — `mentor_start` opens a run, `mentor_get_run` polls progress, `mentor_cancel` aborts. Per-call args, response shape, polling cadence, cursor semantics, and error codes are in each tool's live `description` + `inputSchema`.

- **First turn** vs **resume turn** is determined by whether you pass a prior `mentor_session_token` to `mentor_start`. The token is HMAC-signed and binds (tenant, user, session id, app, agent_resume_id); echo it back **verbatim** on resume.
- The refreshed `mentor_session_token` only appears in the terminal `mentor_get_run.result` (alongside `mentor_session_id`, `summary`, and `events`). Use the newest token on the next start.
- Sessions auto-GC after 30 min idle. Resuming after GC transparently re-downloads the OML; same `mentor_session_id` and conversation continue.
- To call `publish_start` on the edited OML you need `mentor_session_id` + `mentor_session_token` from the most recent terminal-success `mentor_get_run.result`.

**Pacing polls:**

- Poll `mentor_get_run` **immediately** after `mentor_start`, and again immediately while the cursor returns new events — events usually arrive in bursts.
- Pause only when the cursor is drained and `status` isn't terminal. **~30s is a reference**, not a target — without one Claude drifts to 60–180s. `publish_status` / `deploy_status` / `extlib_status` finish faster; shorter pauses are fine.

**When to use the mentor flow vs `context_*`:**
- For *info* about an app, prefer `context_*`. Lightweight, structured, no OML download. Only fall back to mentor when context can't answer (deep OML internals, logic flow traversal).
- For *edits*, the mentor flow is the only path.
- Reuse the same session across follow-up turns in one task; the server-side OML and tool history stay loaded.
- Start a fresh session (call `mentor_start` without `mentor_session_*`) when: (a) mentor hallucinates entities/actions that don't exist; (b) you switch to an unrelated task on the same app; or (c) prior turns left the OML in a bad state.
- If mentor refuses or returns empty, rephrase with concrete keys and a smaller scope before retrying.
- For required fields, ask mentor to set `IsMandatory=True` on the input widget and leave the label text bare — the platform paints a single red `*` after the label automatically. Don't ask mentor to put a literal `*` in `Label.Text`; it renders black, theme-blind, and stacks with the platform asterisk.

## Context Service visibility (`owned_only`)

`context_*` tools index by **visibility**, not ownership: app-scoped queries return owned rows plus rows inherited from referenced libraries (OutSystemsUI, Charts, etc.). Each row carries `isReferenced` and `producerAssetKey`/`producerAssetName`. `owned_only` defaults to `true` when `app` is set, `false` tenant-wide; pass `owned_only: false` with `app` to keep inherited rows.

## Workflows

**Describe an existing app (no OML needed):**
1. If you only have a name, `app_list {search: "<name>"}`, or pass the name directly to `app` on the context tools and let it resolve.
2. Run per-type lookups in parallel:
   - `context_screens {app}` for UI surface
   - `context_entities {app}` for data model
   - `context_actions {app}` for logic
   - `context_roles {app}` for security
   - `app_refs {key}` for dependencies on other modules / external libraries
3. Synthesize into the user-facing explanation.

**Edit an existing app and ship it:**
1. First turn: `mentor_start {app_key, prompt: "Add a due date field to Task"}` returns a `runId`. Poll `mentor_get_run {runId, cursor}` until terminal; pull `mentor_session_id` + `mentor_session_token` out of `result`.
2. Optional follow-up turns: `mentor_start {mentor_session_id, mentor_session_token, prompt: "..."}` and poll the same way. Each terminal result returns a fresh token; use the newest one next.
3. `publish_start {mentor_session_id, mentor_session_token, env_key}` returns `publication_id`.
4. Poll `publish_status {publication_id}` until terminal. Use `publish_logs {pub_key: publication_id}` for messages on failure.

**Promote a build across environments:**
1. `deploy_start {asset_key, env_key: "<target>", from_env: "<source>"}` (or pin with `build_key`+`revision`) returns operation key.
2. Poll `deploy_status {operation_key}` until terminal.
3. On failure: `deploy_messages {operation_key}` for diagnostic messages.

**Publish a new external library:**
1. Build a .NET 8 lib with `[OSInterface(Name = "<UniqueName>")]` (reusing a name produces a new revision, not a fresh asset). `dotnet publish -c Release`, zip the `.dll` + `.deps.json` at the zip root (no nested folder). Base64-encode the zip.
2. `extlib_upload {zip_b64: "<base64>", auto_publish: true}` returns operation key.
3. Poll `extlib_status {operation_key}` until `Published`. On validation failure use `extlib_logs {operation_key}`.

**Reference an external library from an app:**
- Just ask mentor: `mentor_start {app_key, prompt: "Use the <ActionName> action from <LibraryName> in <screen edit>."}`, then poll `mentor_get_run` as usual.

**Run a deployment-impact analysis:**
1. `deploy_impact {key, env_key}` returns analysis id.
2. Poll `deploy_impact_status {analysis_id, kind: "deployment"}` until terminal. Use `kind: "deletion"` instead when you started the analysis with `delete: true`.
