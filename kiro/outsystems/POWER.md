# OutSystems — MCP

## Overview

OutSystems is a cloud-native low-code platform where apps are built from OML (OutSystems Model Language) — a binary format describing entities, screens, actions, and logic. This Power connects Kiro to the **OutSystems MCP server**: a hosted, multi-tenant HTTP transport that exposes the full OutSystems tool surface (`mentor_*`, `app_*`, `context_*`, `deploy_*`, `publish_*`, `extlib_*`, `env_*`).

There is no CLI to install. There is no OML on disk. OML stays server-side; you edit through the mentor flow (`mentor_start` → poll `mentor_get_run`) and ship via `publish_start`.

## Onboarding

### Prerequisites

- Kiro 0.11.133 or newer.
- A web browser on the same machine as Kiro (Kiro picks an ephemeral local port for the OAuth callback after Dynamic Client Registration).
- An OutSystems tenant hostname (e.g. `mycompany.outsystems.dev`).
- Network access to the OutSystems tenant hostname (e.g. `*.outsystems.dev`).

### Installation

This Power doesn't ship its own MCP server config. The first time you ask Kiro Chat to do something with OutSystems, the agent will notice no `outsystems` MCP server is registered, ask you for your tenant hostname, and add an entry to Kiro's user-level `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`. No script, no shell command. Just install the Power and start chatting.

Two ways to install the Power into Kiro:

Both snippets below omit `iconUrl` — the Power installs but shows no logo in Kiro's Powers UI. To enable the logo, add `"iconUrl": "data:image/png;base64,<base64-encoded contents of kiro/outsystems/icon.png>"` to the registry JSON (Kiro's webview CSP blocks `file://`, so a data URL is required). Encode with `base64 -w0` on Linux or `base64 -i` on macOS.

**Option A - clone locally, point Kiro at the local copy.** Most deterministic; doesn't depend on Kiro shelling out to git.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo somewhere (keep this clone — Kiro reads from it)
git clone https://github.com/OutSystems/outsystems-mcp ~/git/outsystems-mcp

# 2. Drop a registry pointer that references the local clone
mkdir -p ~/.kiro/powers/registries
cat > ~/.kiro/powers/registries/outsystems.json <<EOF
{
  "name": "OutSystems",
  "type": "local",
  "powers": [{
    "name": "outsystems",
    "displayName": "OutSystems - MCP",
    "description": "Edit, publish, deploy OutSystems apps from your AI assistant.",
    "source": {"type": "local", "path": "$HOME/git/outsystems-mcp/kiro/outsystems"},
    "autoInstall": true
  }]
}
EOF
```

**Option B - let Kiro clone the repo itself.** Simpler; works over anonymous HTTPS.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kiro/powers/registries
cat > ~/.kiro/powers/registries/outsystems.json <<EOF
{
  "name": "OutSystems",
  "type": "local",
  "powers": [{
    "name": "outsystems",
    "displayName": "OutSystems - MCP",
    "description": "Edit, publish, deploy OutSystems apps from your AI assistant.",
    "source": {
      "type": "repo",
      "repositoryCloneUrl": "https://github.com/OutSystems/outsystems-mcp",
      "pathInRepo": "kiro/outsystems",
      "repositoryBranch": "main"
    },
    "autoInstall": true
  }]
}
EOF
```

Restart Kiro after dropping the registry file. On startup Kiro auto-installs the Power: it copies `POWER.md` and `steering/skill.md` into `~/.kiro/powers/installed/outsystems/`. The Power appears in Kiro's Powers UI; the MCP server itself gets registered by the agent on first use (see the steering content).

Then open Kiro Chat and ask it for anything OutSystems-related; the steering content takes over and the agent walks you through the tenant prompt + OAuth on first use.

### Switching tenants

Just tell Kiro Chat "switch OutSystems to a different tenant" (or similar). The agent will repeat the tenant prompt and update `mcpServers.outsystems.url` in `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`. Kiro's file watcher reloads MCP automatically.

## Common Workflows

Workflows below show MCP tool form. Identity (tenant + user) is derived from the validated bearer JWT — none of the tools take a `tenant` argument.

### Workflow 1: Describe an existing app

1. Resolve the app: `app_list { search: "<name>" }` → app key.
2. In parallel, gather context (independent calls):
   - `context_screens { app: "<key>" }` → UI surface
   - `context_entities { app: "<key>" }` → data model
   - `context_actions { app: "<key>" }` → logic
   - `context_roles { app: "<key>" }` → security
   - `app_refs { key: "<key>" }` → dependencies on libraries / other modules
3. Synthesize for the user.

### Workflow 2: Edit an app and ship it

1. `mentor_start { app_key: "<key>", prompt: "Add a due date field to Task" }` → returns `runId`. Poll `mentor_get_run { runId, cursor }` until terminal; pull `mentor_session_id` + `mentor_session_token` out of `result`.
2. (Optional) Follow-up turns: `mentor_start { mentor_session_id, mentor_session_token, prompt: "..." }` and poll the same way. Each terminal result returns a fresh token; use the newest one next.
3. `publish_start { mentor_session_id, mentor_session_token, env_key: "<env>" }` → returns `publication_id`.
4. Poll `publish_status { publication_id }` until terminal. On failure, `publish_logs { pub_key: publication_id }`.

### Workflow 3: Promote a build across environments

1. `deploy_start { asset_key: "<key>", env_key: "<target>", from_env: "<source>" }` (or pin with `build_key` + `revision`) → returns operation key.
2. Poll `deploy_status { operation_key }` until terminal.
3. On failure: `deploy_messages { operation_key }`.

### Workflow 4: Publish a new external library

1. Build a .NET 8 lib with `[OSInterface(Name = "<UniqueName>")]`. `dotnet publish -c Release`, zip `.dll` + `.deps.json` at the zip root, base64-encode it.
2. `extlib_upload { zip_b64: "<base64>", auto_publish: true }` → returns operation key.
3. Poll `extlib_status { operation_key }` until `Published`. Use `extlib_logs` on validation failure.

## Conventions

- **OML is server-side.** No `app_download`. Use `app_refs` + `context_*` for inspection; the mentor flow (`mentor_start` → poll `mentor_get_run`) for edits. When a user asks for the OML on disk, say plainly that the remote MCP transport does not expose a file-to-local-disk download (the server has no local filesystem to write to), and where useful offer the partially answerable portion (e.g. `app_revisions` for the latest version number).
- **No selected environment.** Every environment-scoped tool takes `env_key` per call; the transport is stateless by design. When a user asks for a session-persistent `env select` style toggle, say so explicitly rather than refusing silently, and reframe the request so they pass `env_key` per call.
- **No local CWD.** The server has no view of the caller's filesystem. When a user asks about local paths, working directories, or CWD-relative artifacts, state the limit plainly and surface the closest server-side data inline (e.g. paste the `env_list` payload back so the user can save it themselves) instead of attempting the operation. Don't silently route a write or a read through a non-MCP tool; the architectural fact has to reach the user.
- **Operations return immediately.** `deploy_start`, `deploy_rollback`, `deploy_impact`, `publish_start`, `extlib_upload`, `extlib_publish`, `extlib_download_source` all return an operation/publication/analysis id; poll the matching `*_status` tool.
- **Never invent IDs.** App keys, env keys, build keys, operation keys are opaque. Resolve them via `app_list`, `env_list`, etc., or ask the user.

## Troubleshooting

### MCP server unreachable

**Symptom:** Kiro reports the `outsystems` server as not configured / not connected, or tools return `tenant not configured` errors.

**Solutions:**
1. Have you completed the first-use tenant prompt? Open Kiro Chat and ask anything OutSystems-related; the agent will notice the missing server entry and walk you through it.
2. Verify the install: `jq '.installedPowers[] | select(.name=="outsystems")' ~/.kiro/powers/installed.json` should return the entry, and `jq '.mcpServers.outsystems' ~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` should return an object with a `https://<your-tenant>/mcp` URL.
3. If there's no `outsystems` entry under top-level `mcpServers`, the tenant prompt was skipped or interrupted. Tell Kiro Chat "set up OutSystems again" and complete the flow.
4. Verify network reachability: `curl -I "<URL-from-settings>"` should return an HTTP response (likely 401 without a bearer; that's expected and means routing works).

### OAuth doesn't open / callback fails

**Symptom:** Browser tab doesn't open, OR the browser shows "site can't be reached" / a redirect-uri mismatch on the `localhost:<port>/callback` page.

**Solutions:**
1. **Browser didn't open at all:** re-trigger the sign-in — ask Kiro Chat to retry the OutSystems action (the first tool call re-initiates OAuth), or authenticate the `outsystems` server from Kiro's MCP UI. Kiro owns the OAuth flow; there is no agent-callable `authenticate` tool to invoke.
2. **Callback page shows "site can't be reached":** Kiro listens on an ephemeral `localhost` port for the callback, so a browser must be reachable on the same machine as Kiro (see Prerequisites). On a remote/SSH session without a local browser, run Kiro where a browser can reach `localhost` and retry.
3. **DCR or auth-handshake errors:** surface the error message verbatim and file an issue against `OutSystems/outsystems-mcp` with the symptoms.
4. **Last resort:** remove and re-add the `outsystems` server in Kiro's MCP UI to wipe stale OAuth state, then ask Kiro Chat to redo the first-use steering flow.

### Tool errors

Errors carry a structured category in `data.category` (`AuthError`, `ValidationError`, `UpstreamError`, `InternalError`); upstream errors also include `data.upstream_status`. Use these for retry decisions, not the message text.

## Limitations

- **No `app_download` on this transport.** OML stays in the server-side mentor session and never crosses the wire as bytes.
- **No per-session "selected environment".** Every environment-scoped tool takes `env_key` per call.
- **Long-running tools return immediately.** `deploy_start`, `deploy_rollback`, `deploy_impact`, `publish_start`, `extlib_upload`, `extlib_publish`, `extlib_download_source` all return an operation/publication/analysis id; you must poll the matching `*_status` tool.
- **Mentor session GC after 30 min idle.** Resuming after GC transparently re-downloads OML (sticky-miss recovery), but the first turn after that pause is slower.

## Configuration files

The Power's installed state (created by Kiro's auto-install when it processes the registry file):

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.kiro/powers/registries/outsystems.json` | LocalRegistrySchema; points at the Power source. |
| `~/.kiro/powers/installed.json` | Lists `outsystems` as installed. |
| `~/.kiro/powers/installed/outsystems/POWER.md` | This file (copied from source). |
| `~/.kiro/powers/installed/outsystems/steering/skill.md` | Agent-facing skill content; loads into the chat agent's context whenever the Power is active. Drives the tenant prompt + MCP wiring + OAuth. |
| `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` | Kiro's MCP loader file. The agent writes the tenant URL to top-level `mcpServers.outsystems` here on first use. The Power has no per-install `mcp.json`, so Kiro's update flow can't corrupt the tenant URL. |
